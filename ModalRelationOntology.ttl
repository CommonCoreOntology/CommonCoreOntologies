For example, if a financial report x describes the quarterly results of a company y and that same financial report describes the quarterly results of a company z, then it should be inferred that companies y and z are the same. We refrained from classifying the relation as a functional property on the concern that descriptions are multifaceted and so consequently it may be that the same report would contain descriptions of multiple entities."@en ;
