# diff-reports-previous-version

The diff files located here for changes between versions 1.6 and 1.7 do NOT include the changes introduced by replacing and deprecating the four annotation properties. That change introduced a sweeping set of changes, which results in unnecessary and useless noise to the diff files.

However, for sake of completness, we are including an additional set of diff files in the subdirectory `anno-prop-diffs` that reflect the changes ONLY relevant to the last commit `5dbff3d` where the four new properties were mapped to the deprecated ones.
