#### Removed
- [Domain of a Country](http://www.ontologyrepository.com/CommonCoreOntologies/Country) [editorialNote](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#editorialNote) "'Country' is an unclear term. Does it refer to the people, the government, the site, or the material in the site? Furthermore, what is properly referred to as a 'Country' is highly dependent on the classification practices of the international community. For example: The United Kingdom is a sovereign country that has Wales, a non-sovereign Country, as a member. Vatican City is a sovereign country that is landlocked by a city: Rome, Italy. Puerto Rico is not a country (it's a territory) but has a government, a distinct culture, and so on. Thus, here we do not definine 'Country' but instead define 'Domain of a Country'."@en
